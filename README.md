# Maternal and Child Health Monitoring in LMICs

## Introduction

The **Maternal and Child Health Monitoring in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)** research project aims to leverage machine learning techniques applied to satellite imagery and other geotagged data sources to monitor key indicators of maternal and child health (MCH) status in LMICs. The project seeks to demonstrate that village- and neighborhood-level prevalence of various MCH indicators can be accurately estimated using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this research project is to develop robust machine learning models capable of accurately estimating MCH indicators at a granular level based on satellite imagery and geotagged data. By leveraging remote sensing technology and publicly available data sources, the project aims to provide timely and cost-effective monitoring solutions for MCH status in LMICs.
