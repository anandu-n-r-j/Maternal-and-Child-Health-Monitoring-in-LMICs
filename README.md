# Maternal-and-Child-Health-Monitoring-in-LMICs
**Machine learning in satellite imagery and other geotagged data sources to monitor health in low- and middle-income countries**:
This research project aims to demonstrate that machine learning in satellite imagery and other publicly available geotagged data can accurately estimate key indicators of MCH status. Our hypothesis is that the village- and neighborhood-level prevalence of child undernutrition indicators, anemia in children and women of reproductive age, child and maternal mortality, and childhood illness episodes (diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections) can be accurately estimated from satellite imagery and other geotagged data.
